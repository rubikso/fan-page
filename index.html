                Twenty One Pilots is the hottest band on the pop scene right now! Started in 2009 by singer/songwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Joseph">Tyler Joseph</a> with 2 other members, they released their first self-produced album self titled as "Twenty One Pilots". Shortly thereafter, the guitarist and the drummer left the band, only for Tyler to find his new drummer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dun">Joshua Dun</a>. To this day they have become the best of friends and released 3 more albums, 2 of which were released on the "Fueled by Ramen" record label, and the boys have performed on several local and world tours due to their success on the music scene.

                                The first official album of the band released in 2009, completely comprised of songs written by Tyler Joseph, it is a unique blend of poetry, synthesized music, rap, and many other genres included in the album. Dot be deceived, the songs on this album may sound happy, but the lyrics are full of despair.</dd>

                                The second album released by the band in 2011, this time as the iconic duo they are today, Joshua Dun having joined the band really adds depth to the music with his talent on the drums. The album features equally dark songs as the previous album, subliminally explaining the struggles of depression.</dd>
