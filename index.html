<h1>Twenty One Pilots is Sick as Frick!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Twenty One Pilots is the hottest band on the pop scene right now! Started in 2009 by singer/songwriter Tyler Joseph with 2 other members, they released their first self produced album self titled as "Twenty One Pilots". Shortly therafter, the guitarist and the drummer left the band, only for Tyler to find his new drummer, Joshua Dun. To this day they have become the best of friends and released 3 more albums, 2 of which were released on the "Fueled by Ramen" record label, and the boys have performed on several local and world tours due to their success on the music scene.</p><br>

    <dt>"Self Titled&nbsp;/&nbsp;Twenty One Pilots"</dt>
        <dd>The first official album of the band leased in 2009, completely comprised of songs written by Tyler Joseph, it is a unique blend of poetry, syntesized music, rap, and many other genres included in the album. Dot be deceived, the songs on this album may sound happy, but the lyrics are full of despair.</dd>
        
    <dt>"Regional at Best"</dt>
